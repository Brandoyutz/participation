# Lecture 1

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

To prepare for lecture 1, I installed a virtual machine on my laptop so Linux could be put on it for the first day of class. I also loooked over the reading material for the first day.

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I contributed in class by introducing myself, and I answeres my partner's question, but I have forgotten what it was about. 

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

The day wasn't too confusing; we spent most of the time intalling linux on our machines. The hardest part was making sure my settings were correct so Linux could run.


# Lecture 2

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

I think I read the slide to see what was required for the day, so I skimmed over the assigned reading. 

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

During lecture, I followed along and discussed issues I was having with my system with my partner.

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

I created my first directory in the wrong place, so anytime I needed to do something, I need permission. This slowed me down, so I fell a little behind as we went through the lecture. I have since made a directory for the same purpose in a different place where I won't always need permission. 


# Lecture 3

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

To prepare, I made a cheat sheet based off of the reading I did. 

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I pretty much followed along. Conversed with my neighbor if I had any problems.

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

I think everything was fairly clear. Some of the syntax for modifers was a little confusing, as it needs to be in a specific order. 


# Lecture 4

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

Continued to do the reading, but I don't think I made any additions to my cheat sheet. 

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I was good a student; I didn't act out or cause a commotion or anything. 

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

By this time, I feel mostly confident about all the commands we have covered, but learning a command is sometime confusing. You need to know what it does, how to type it, and remember all the arguements.


# Lecture 5

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

Did the reading about bash, and made a bash little cheat sheet

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I think I was able to follow along and clarified or recieved clarification from my neighbor.

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

We learned Bash, and because my playground folder hadn't been moved yet, I don't think I was actually able to get a bash program to work. I got a litltle freaked out because he mentioned assignment 2 when he never even mentioned assignment 1. I still had a few days to turn it in, and in retrospect, it wasn't that difficult of an assignment.


# Lecture 6

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

I did the reading, created a Github account, and started the assignment. We also dual booted Linux on my laptop so Linux would run faster. It has definitely helped.

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I wrote the dean an email about how our door was locked a few times at the joking request of Dr. Roberts. I didn't get around to sending it.

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

We learned about using git. The specific order of getting stuff submitted seemed a little confusing, but with some practice, I think I have it all down. It does help that git kind of walks you through it.


# Lecture 7

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

I got my assignent submitted. 

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I'm pretty sure I asked a question relevent to git, but I forgot what it was.

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

I think what I'm confused about is how I upload stuff to my git account. I haven't had a need fo this yet, so I haven't asked the question.


# Lecture 8

## How Did I Prepare Before Lecture?

I got my participation file up to date.

## How Did I Contribute During Lecture?

I confirmed that I was seeing what I should be seeing after forking the file from git.

## What Was or Is The Most Confusing Thing?

Collaborating still feels very confusing. I don't quite have the whole forking and merging thing figured out. I think once we finish the example that we were suposed to finish today, I and actually do the process a few times, I'll be fine.
